## React Blog App
-----
This app was created using React.  The features include:
1. Fetching from a public API
2. Posting to the API.
3. When posting to the API, the user is re-directed using react router.  The user is redirected after a fresh fetch of the data, so the user will see their post at the top.
4. The routes to the individual posts are dynamic and update with the post ID from the database.
5. The styling is done with bootstrap.
